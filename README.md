Hi there! 👋 
🌧️ My Featured Project: Rainfall Prediction

This project demonstrates the development of a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of rainfall. Traditional weather forecasting methods, including those used by meteorological departments, can be imprecise. This model aims to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging historical atmospheric data to identify patterns and relationships that influence rainfall.

The model is built to solve a classification problem: given a set of atmospheric factors, it will predict a binary outcome—whether or not there will be rainfall. This approach is well-suited for this task, as machine learning models can effectively learn from complex, high-dimensional data that often challenges traditional rule-based systems.
